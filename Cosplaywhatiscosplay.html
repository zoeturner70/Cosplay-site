        <div class ="greenboxwhatiscosplay"><p>The word “Cosplay” comes from a combination of the words “costume” and “play” by Nobuyuki Takahashi in 1984. Cosplay originated in Japan in the 1970s and started at sci-fi conventions where fans would dress up as their favourite characters. Overtime, it became a popular hobby worldwide, expanding to include characters from movies, TV shows, video games and more. Cosplay became more popular is the US with the rise of anime and manga in Western culture. Cosplay contests became popular in the 1990s but came around before in 1984 where the first cosplay contest took place at the World Science Fiction Convention in Los Angeles. Since then, the popularity of cosplay has skyrocketed! With a world-wide community that all partake, no matter the skill level. Conventions such as Comic Cons have become more and more cosplay-based with a big attraction of attending is seeing and joining other cosplayers. There is no real definition of what a cosplayer is as the term is both flexible and accepting. Whether someone is a novice sew or a professional they are accepted as part of the community where they can learn amongst each other how to develop those skills and learn more. Some cosplayers even make a living out of their hobby, either by selling costume pieces, brand sponsorships or teaching their craft there really isn’t any end to the possibilities of cosplay.</p></div>
